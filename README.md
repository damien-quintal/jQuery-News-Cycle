jQuery-News-Cycle
=================

jQuery news cycle is a simple news/feed cycling plugin

A big thanks to the work done by Jorge Epu√±an with his jQuery Timelinr plugin (which this plugin is based on).

V0.1 - Adding the ability to start the cycle from the beginning once the end is reached.

Coming soon:

V0.2 - Adding in screen orientation detection for mobie browsers.
